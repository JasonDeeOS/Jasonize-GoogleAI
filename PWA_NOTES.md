# PWA Setup Notes

This project has been configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA) using `vite-plugin-pwa`.

## Configuration
The main configuration is in `vite.config.ts`.
- **Manifest**: Defines the app name, colors, and icons.
- **Workbox**: Configures caching strategies.
    - Static assets (js, css, html, images) are precached.
    - API calls to `api.github.com` use a `NetworkFirst` strategy with a 1-day cache fallback.

## Icons
Icons are located in the `public/` directory:
- `pwa-192x192.png`
- `pwa-512x512.png`

To update the icons, simply replace these files with your own PNGs of the same dimensions.

## Service Worker
The service worker is auto-generated by Vite during the build process.
- **Dev Mode**: The service worker might not be fully active in dev mode by default unless configured.
- **Production**: Run `npm run build` and `npm run preview` to test the full PWA experience locally.

## Verification
1. Run `npm run build`.
2. Run `npm run preview`.
3. Open `http://localhost:4173` (or the port shown).
4. Open Chrome DevTools -> Application tab.
5. Check "Manifest" for valid metadata and icons.
6. Check "Service Workers" to see the registered worker.
7. Look for the install icon in the address bar.
